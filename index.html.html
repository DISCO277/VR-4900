    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Michael Alloy, and I currently a junior at Ohio University. I am majoring in Games and Animations and I'm taking this class as a part of my corollary. I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and I graduated from Madiera High School.</p>
    <h2>Things I like!</h2>
    <p>My main interest is video games. My favorites include Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Dark Souls, Guilty Gear, Super Smash Bros, and Team Fortress 2. Outside of video games I enjoy music, and I'm experimenting with cooking!</p>
    <p>In fact, here is a link to a funny video!</p>

    <h2>My Experiece with Coding.</h3>
    <p>I don't think I'm very good at coding. I've learned some C# and other languages, but none have stuck with me due in part to how little I'm interested in coding.</p>
    <p>However, Html is definitely different from them in lots of ways. I'm keeping a schedule to make sure I practice the use of this language and CSS. I'll definitely need to utilize the resouces given to me.</p>
