    <h2 style="color: red;">My Experiece with Coding.</h3>
    <p>I don't think I'm very good at coding. I've learned some C# and other languages, but none have stuck with me due in part to how little I'm interested in coding.</p>
    <p>However, Html is definitely different from them in lots of ways. I'm keeping a schedule to make sure I practice the use of this language and CSS. I'll definitely need to utilize the resouces given to me.</p>
